I've provided code for the authorization (oauth2) protocol for Google
calendars.  There is also a picker for a date range. 

## Functions
Application  allow the user to choose calendars (a single
user may have several Google calendars, one of which is the 'primary'
calendar) and list 'blocking'  (non-transparent) appointments between a start date and an end date for some subset of them.

##Test
not ready
